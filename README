Wrapper around ffmpeg + realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan that enables easy video upscaling
without the immense disk usage incurred by the official video upscaling method
documented by the Real-ESRGAN developers.

Standard video upscaling with realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan involves using ffmpeg to
split a video into individual frames, then upscale them with realesrcan-ncnn-vulkan, 
and finally reencode the upscaled frames into a new video. Because the
benefit of inter-frame compression is lost during frame splitting, a modestly
sized video of around 200MiB will end up ballooning to several hundred GiB (!!)
of frames on disk. This immensely slows the upscaling process and burns through
SSD writes.

This program solves the issue by decoding, upscaling, and reencoding frames, on
the fly, in memory (in /tmp, which is typically a ramdisk on modern Linux). As a
result, upscaling becomes appreciably faster and only requires enough disk space
to write the final upscaled video.

The program also automatically downloads & caches realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan along
with the official trained upscaling models.
